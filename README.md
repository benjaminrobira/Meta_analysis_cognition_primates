# Meta analysis of brain size in primates :monkey:

This repository stores all material linked to "**Species sympatry shapes brain size evolution in Primates**" by *Benjamin Robira* and *Beno√Æt Perez-Lamarque*.

It is divided into several folders:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Raw_data  
It includes a) brain and associated data (each within a folder named after their study of origin) b) phylogenetic trees (from the 10kTrees project/consensus tree, larger than the 10kTrees one, used for diversification analysis; "Tree" file). IUCN data should be directly requested to the IUCN.

## :file_folder: Scripts

It includes: 
  - The script with all necessary functions to make the EvolutionaryHistoryClusterRun_X work (`Function`).
* :bomb: Analysis1_competitionsignal: Analysis to see whether brain size evolution in frugivorous primates is better predicted by models accounting or not for sympatry.
  - The script for cleaning, merging, and processing ranging data and attribute/trait data (`DataCleaning`).
  - The script with prior run of the biogeobear algorithm to retrace biogeography history (`BioGeoBEARSRun`).
  - The script(s) for running the analysis on the cluster (e.g. `EvolutionaryHistoryClusterRun_a1b1`). 
  - The script for extracting and plotting results from cluster run (`EvolutionaryHistoryAnalysis`). 
* :arrow_right: Analysis2_competitiondirection: Analysis based on PGLS to see the direction of the effect of sympatry on brain size
  - The script for extracting the necessary spatial covariates: number of sympatric species, and average overlap (`SpatialProcessingSympatry`). 
  - The script for conducting the PGLS analysis on selection direction (`PGLSdirectionSelection`).
* :herb: Analysis3_diversification: Analysis to see whether how the diversification rate covaries with brain size or sympatry
  - The script for running the diversification algorithm ClaDS on the cluster (`script_diversification_primates`). 
  - The script for conducting the PGLS analysis on diversification and brain size (`PGLSdiversification_bayesian` - non-Bayesian version also available, but suffered from bias).
  - The script for conducting the PGLS analysis on diversification and sympatry (`PGLSdiversificationAndSympatry`).
  - The file with all inputs/outputs from the diversification analysis.

## :page_with_curl: Article

It includes the R markdown document that corresponds to the written version of the article ("Article.Rmd") and the associated bibtex file for article reference only (intern compilation for adding *R* packages; "biliograpphyarticle.bib"). Supplementary files (the .lua and the .csl) are added so as to allow correct compilation. They must be stored together with the .Rmd file.
