# Meta analysis of cognition in primates :monkey:

This repository stores all material linked to "**Primate Cognition and the Red Queen Intelligence Hypothesis**" by Benjamin Robira and Beno√Æt Perez-Lamarque.

It is divided into several folders:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Raw_data  
It includes a) brain and associated data (each within a folder named after their study of origin) b) phylogenetic trees (from the 10kTrees project, "Tree" file).

## :file_folder: Scripts

It includes: 
  - The script with all necessary functions to make the EvolutionaryHistoryClusterRun_X work (`Function`).
* :bomb: Analysis1_competitionsignal: Analysis to see whether brain size evolution in frugivorous primates is better predicted by models with or without competition.
  - The script for cleaning, merging, and processing ranging data and attribute/trait data (`DataCleaning`).
  - The script with prior run of the biogeobear algorithm to retrace biogeography history (`BioGeoBEARSRun`).
  - The script(s) for running the analysis on the cluster (e.g. `EvolutionaryHistoryClusterRun_a1b1`). 
  - The script for extracting and plotting results from cluster run (`EvolutionaryHistoryAnalysis`). 
* :arrow_right: Analysis2_competitiondirection: Analysis based on PGLS to see for areas that are best predicted by competitive models the direction of the selection
  - The script for extracting the necessary spatial covariates: number of sympatric species, and average overlap (`SpatialProcessingSympatry`). 
  - The script for conducting the PGLS analysis on selection direction (`PGLSdirectionSelection`).
* :herb: Analysis3_diversification: Analysis to see whether how the diversification rate covaries with brain size
  - The script for running the diversification algorithm ClaDS on the cluster (`DiversificationCluster`). 
  - The script for conducting the PGLS analysis on diversification (`PGLSdiversification`). (still not done)
  - The file with all inputs/outputs from the diversification analysis.

## :page_with_curl: Article

It includes the R markdown document that is actually the written version of the article ("Article.Rmd") and the associated bibtex file for article reference only (intern compilation for adding *R* packages; "biliograpphyarticle.bib"). Supplementary files (the .lua and the .csl) are added so as to allow correct compilation. They must be stored together with the .Rmd file.
